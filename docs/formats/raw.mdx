title: Raw Format
description: Crawl outputs (`raw/`) and `crawl.jsonl`.
---

The Raw snapshot is the output of `sitebookify crawl`.

## Directory layout

```text
raw/
  crawl.jsonl
  html/
    <host_or_host_port>/<path...>/index.html
```

## `crawl.jsonl`

`crawl.jsonl` is JSON Lines (one JSON object per line).

Fields (MVP):

- `url` (string): requested URL (normalized).
- `normalized_url` (string): URL after normalization.
  - Fragments (`#...`) are removed.
  - Query strings (`?...`) are removed.
  - Trailing slashes are removed (except for `/` itself).
- `depth` (number): BFS-like traversal depth (start URL is `0`).
- `status` (number): HTTP status code.
  - If the request fails, `0` is recorded.
- `content_type` (string, optional): response Content-Type.
- `retrieved_at` (string): RFC 3339 timestamp.
- `raw_html_path` (string, optional): filesystem path to the saved HTML.
  - Only set for `text/html` + 2xx responses.

## Snapshot constraints

Raw snapshots are treated as immutable.

- `sitebookify crawl` MUST NOT overwrite existing files under `raw/`.
- If the output directory already exists, `crawl` fails (MVP behavior).

## Host and port mapping

If the URL includes an explicit port, `:` is replaced with `_` in the directory name.
Example: `127.0.0.1:12345` → `127.0.0.1_12345`
