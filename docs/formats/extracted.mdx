title: Extracted Pages Format
description: Extracted Markdown pages (`extracted/pages/*.md`).
---

Extracted Pages are the output of `sitebookify extract`.

Main content extraction uses Mozilla Readability (Firefox Reader Mode) via `readability-js`.

## Directory layout

```text
extracted/
  pages/
    p_<sha256_hex>.md
```

## File structure

Each extracted page is a Markdown file with YAML front matter.

```md
---
id: "p_<sha256_hex>"
url: "https://agentskills.io/intro"
retrieved_at: "2026-01-23T10:25:00Z"
raw_html_path: "raw/html/example.com/docs/intro/index.html"
title: "Intro"
---

# Intro

...body...
```

Front matter fields (MVP):

- `id`: `p_` + sha256 hex of the normalized URL.
- `url`: normalized URL (query and fragment removed).
- `retrieved_at`: RFC 3339 timestamp.
- `raw_html_path`: filesystem path to the corresponding Raw HTML.
- `title`: extracted page title.

## Snapshot constraints

Extracted Pages are treated as immutable.

- `sitebookify extract` MUST NOT overwrite existing files under `extracted/`.
- If the output directory already exists, `extract` fails (MVP behavior).
