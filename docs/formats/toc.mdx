title: TOC Format
description: TOC schema and intent.

The TOC (table of contents) is the output of `sitebookify toc init`.
It defines how Extracted Pages are grouped into chapters when rendering a book.

## Schema (MVP)

`toc.yaml` is YAML and has this shape:

```yaml
book_title: "Example Docs Textbook"
parts:
  - title: "Part 1"
    chapters:
      - id: "ch01"
        title: "Docs"
        sources:
          - "p_<sha256_hex>"
```

Fields:

- `book_title` (string): rendered book title.
- `parts` (list):
  - `title` (string): part title.
  - `chapters` (list):
    - `id` (string): chapter id (used as the output filename).
    - `title` (string): chapter title.
    - `sources` (list[string]): ordered list of Manifest IDs.

## Proto schema

The schema corresponds to `proto/sitebookify/v1/toc.proto` (`Toc`).
