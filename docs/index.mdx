description: Crawl a public website and generate mdBook Markdown.
---

Sitebookify is a CLI that crawls a public website (no login), extracts readable Markdown pages, and renders an mdBook project.

This repository keeps all documentation content under `docs/` so it can be deployed with Mintlify. The site configuration lives in `docs/docs.json`.

## Quick start

One-shot example:

```sh
sitebookify build \
  --url https://example.com/docs/ \
  --out workspace
# --title is optional (derived from toc.yaml / LLM)
```

Next: [CLI overview](/cli/overview)

## Limitations (MVP)

- robots.txt is not supported.
- Only `text/html` pages are saved and extracted.
- No authentication flows (login-required websites are out of scope).

## Build and run

This repository uses Nix Flakes as the source of truth for the development environment.

Build:

```sh
nix develop -c cargo build
nix develop -c cargo build --release
```

Run (from source):

```sh
nix develop -c cargo run -- crawl --url https://example.com/docs/ --out raw
```

## CI checks

CI runs the same quality gates as local development.

Recommended locally (direnv):

```sh
direnv allow
just ci
```

CI (and without direnv):

```sh
nix develop -c just ci
```

If you update documentation, run the documentation checks locally before opening a PR.
