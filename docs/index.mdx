title: Introduction
description: How this repository structures docs, Protobuf schemas, and CI checks.
---

This repository keeps all documentation content under `docs/` so it can be deployed with Mintlify.
The site configuration lives in `docs/docs.json`.

## Protobuf

Protobuf schemas are managed with Buf and follow Google's API Improvement Proposals (AIP) with a resource-oriented design.

- Start here: [Protobuf overview](/protobuf/overview)
- Design guidelines: [Resource-oriented design (AIP)](/protobuf/resource-oriented)
- Validation annotations: [Protovalidate](/protobuf/validation)
- Tooling and CI: [Buf and CI checks](/protobuf/buf-and-ci)

## CI checks

CI runs the same quality gates as local development.

Recommended locally (direnv):

```sh
direnv allow
just ci
```

CI (and without direnv):

```sh
nix develop -c just ci
```

If you update documentation, run the documentation checks locally before opening a PR.
