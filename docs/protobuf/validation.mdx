description: How to add validation rules to schema messages.
---

This repository uses Protovalidate annotations (not `protoc-gen-validate`).

Protovalidate adds schema-level validation rules that can be enforced at runtime by language-specific libraries.

## When to validate

Use validation rules primarily on:

- Fields that must be well-formed (IDs, URL-like strings, file paths)
- Repeated fields that must be non-empty (lists that are required by the format)

## Example

```proto
string id = 1 [(buf.validate.field).string.pattern = "^p_[0-9a-f]{64}$"];
```

In Sitebookify, these rules are used as references for the on-disk formats.
