title: Buf and CI Checks
description: How Buf, documentation linting, and CI are wired together.
---

## Buf workflow

This template uses Buf for:

- Formatting: `buf format`
- Linting: `buf lint`
- Dependency pinning: `buf dep update` (writes `buf.lock`)

## CI integration

CI runs the same commands as local development.

Recommended locally (direnv):

```sh
direnv allow
just ci
```

CI (and without direnv):

```sh
nix develop -c just ci
```

If you change Protobuf schemas, ensure `buf lint` passes.
If you change documentation, ensure the documentation linters and link checks pass.
