# Private Key Management

LDK provides a default implementation for key management, but you can choose to provide private keys to LDK in any way you wish following a simple API. LDK even supports a generic API for signing transactions, allowing you to run LDK without any private keys in memory and/or putting private keys only on hardware wallets.

While LDK's default implementation is currently located within the `rust-lightning` crate, it is still considered a sample module.
