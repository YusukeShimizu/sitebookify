### Introduction

Lightning Development Kit (LDK) is a full and completely standalone Lightning implementation with supporting modules enabling greater flexibility.

You can build a Lightning node without needing to worry about getting all of the Lightning state machine, routing, and on-chain punishment code (and other chain interactions) exactly correct. LDK tends to be suitable for use cases where a degree of customization is desired, e.g. your own chain sync, your own key management and/or your own storage/backup logic.

Our [sample node (opens new window)](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-sample) showcases how LDK can be customised. It fetches blockchain data and transacts on-chain via Bitcoin Core RPC/REST. The individual components of the sample are composable. For example, the sample writes channel state to the local filesystem, but this component could be replaced with one that writes this data to the cloud or to multiple locations. You can pick the off-the-shelf parts you want and replace the rest.

### [#](#rust-documentation) [Rust Documentation (opens new window)](https://docs.rs/lightning) ###

These provide the most searchable and comprehensive documentation on LDK.
If you're using Java and want more information on any method/struct/etc., searching
the Rust docs for the Rust version of that struct/method is your best bet.

### [#](#swift-ldk-documentation) [Swift LDK Documentation (opens new window)](https://github.com/arik-so/SwiftLightning/tree/master/Documentation) ###

These docs are mainly geared towards how Swift could call LDK C bindings directly, but still may
provide a useful overview of Rust Lightning in the context of language bindings.

### [#](#rust-sample-node) [Rust Sample Node (opens new window)](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-sample) ###

The sample serves as a complete reference for constructing a Lightning node with
the LDK. This is a good starting point if you want a self-guided tour!

### [#](#architecture) [Architecture](/introduction/architecture/) ###

Gives a high-level organization of LDK and how the pieces fit together. Variations of this diagram
are used throughout the site. This is the primary source and is still a work in progress.

### Architecture

![Architecture](/assets/img/ldk-architecture.c9d2bfc6.svg)

Firstly, LDK is not a daemon, but rather its own implementation of the Lightning protocol written as an SDK and designed to be compiled and executed in your application.

This makes it environment agnostic, allowing you to choose your own data storage, wallet, networking stack and blockchain monitoring. In the diagram above the boxes with dotted borders are LDK's modules — these must be configured with either default or custom implementations that you provide.

LDK also uses an event-driven architecture which allows for asynchronous result notification. For example you perform actions like making payments without waiting for the result and are later made aware via an event if the payment was successful or not.

Language Bindings

Although the core SDK is written in Rust, LDK supports many other programming languages. These include Java/Kotlin, Swift, JavaScript/TypeScript (Beta), C++ (Alpha). Check out [examples](/examples/) to see some of the implementations out in the wild!

### Blockchain Data

LDK provides a simple `block_connected`/`block_disconnected` API which you pass block headers and transaction information to. LDK also provides an API for getting information about transactions it wishes to be informed of, which is compatible with Electrum server requests/neutrino filtering/etc.

### Networking

To enable you to run a full Lightning node on an embedded machine, LDK doesn't specify exactly how to connect to another node at all! The default implementation uses TCP sockets, but, e.g., if you wanted to run your full Lightning node on a hardware wallet, you could, by piping the Lightning network messages over USB/serial and then sending them in a TCP socket from another machine.

### Peer Management

![Peer Management](/assets/img/ldk-peer-management.ac42ca47.svg)

One of the first things you'll need to do when building your own Lightning node is connect to a peer. In LDK this is handled by the [`PeerManager` (opens new window)](https://docs.rs/lightning/*/lightning/ln/peer_handler/struct.PeerManager.html).

The `PeerManager` has two dependencies:

* A [`ChannelManager` (opens new window)](https://docs.rs/lightning/*/lightning/ln/channelmanager/index.html) that enables it to notify peers when it wants to do things such as open channels.
* A [`P2PGossipSync` (opens new window)](https://docs.rs/lightning/*/lightning/routing/gossip/struct.P2PGossipSync.html) that understands when peers you are connected to send you gossip messages, enables you to forward messages, announce channel opens and more.

Since LDK knows nothing about your networking stack, you'll need to implement your own networking logic in order to connect to peers on the network. Provide LDK with raw TCP/IP socket data and the library will handle the rest for you.

LDK also handles a number of background tasks that need to happen periodically via [`BackgroundProcessor` (opens new window)](https://docs.rs/lightning-background-processor/*/lightning_background_processor/struct.BackgroundProcessor.html)

### Persistent Storage

You can store the channel state any way you want - whether Google Drive/iCloud, a local disk, any key-value store/database/a remote server, or any combination of them - LDK provides a clean API, where objects can be serialized into simple binary blobs, and stored in any way you wish.

Last Updated: 11/3/2025, 7:01:09 PM

### Private Key Management

LDK provides a default implementation for key management, but you can choose to provide private keys to LDK in any way you wish following a simple API. LDK even supports a generic API for signing transactions, allowing you to run LDK without any private keys in memory and/or putting private keys only on hardware wallets.

While LDK's default implementation is currently located within the `rust-lightning` crate, it is still considered a sample module.

### Random Number Generation

LDK aims to make no system calls, it is therefore restricted from generating its own randomness.

The sample node implementation uses Rust's `rand` crate [here (opens new window)](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-sample/blob/2cd778e7acc959689e3b8462c529ffb3509aa1ec/src/main.rs#L464-L465) and elsewhere.

### Transactions

[\#](#transaction-filtering) Transaction Filtering
----------

Clients running a light client may wish to filter for transactions on a separate server, in which case LDK will tell them about transactions to filter for.

More information is available in the [Blockchain Data guide](/blockchain_data/introduction).

[\#](#fee-estimation) Fee Estimation
----------

LDK let's you decide your source for fee estimation. This could be Bitcoin Core's fee estimation through `estimatesmartfee` RPC method or third-party [fee-estimators (opens new window)](https://b10c.me/blog/003-a-list-of-public-bitcoin-feerate-estimation-apis/).

[LDK's `FeeEstimator` docs (opens new window)](https://docs.rs/lightning/*/lightning/chain/chaininterface/trait.FeeEstimator.html)

LDK's sample node implementation uses Bitcoin Core's fee estimation API [here. (opens new window)](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-sample/blob/2cd778e7acc959689e3b8462c529ffb3509aa1ec/src/bitcoind_client.rs#L98-L154)

[\#](#transaction-broadcasting) Transaction Broadcasting
----------

You can broadcast transactions in a few ways, using Bitcoin core or other [external API's (opens new window)](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_broadcasting)

[LDK's `BroadcasterInterface` docs (opens new window)](https://docs.rs/lightning/*/lightning/chain/chaininterface/trait.BroadcasterInterface.html)

### Use Cases for LDK

The standard Lightning use case is running a standalone node on one's laptop.
Here's some other use cases that LDK supports.

[\#](#mobile-devices) Mobile Devices
----------

Mobile devices with Lightning have unique requirements often not well served by
today's Lightning ecosystem. Not only do they need to operate with minimal
footprint, they also have intermittent data access and cannot shutdown safely.
More importantly, many existing wallets already have business logic to handle
blockchain data, keys, and storage, and do not wish to duplicate much of that
logic to integrate Lightning (at worst fetching the blockchain twice). LDK
offers a flexible API to allow users to integrate Lightning with their own keys,
blockchain data, and storage. To allow full flexibility in footprint, the API
supports routing data being fetched via the Lightning P2P protocol, an external
service, or routes can be calculated off-device. It also provides cross-platform
compatibility for free, allowing synchronization of Lightning state across
devices and, as long as there is protection from simultaneous updates, users to
access their wallet on any device. See the [architecure](../architecture) page for more
details on the interfaces LDK provides for integration.

[\#](#hsms-hardware-security-modules) HSMs (Hardware Security Modules)
----------

LDK Supports various HSM configurations. In conjunction with the [Validating Lightning Signer (opens new window)](https://vls.tech/)project, an external HSM can be
used to verify most protocol details about states before signing, ensuring host
compromise cannot steal funds by broadcasting revoked states. For nodes seeking
a higher level of assurance, the entire LDK channel state machine can
be run on an offline device, communicating with the outside world via a proxy
host which maintains TCP connections with peers. Such a configuration ensures
all details of the Lightning protocol are enforced without consideration of host
compromise.

[\#](#production-lightning-nodes) Production Lightning Nodes
----------

Many large Bitcoin transactors have large amounts of custom-built infrastructure
for interacting with the Bitcoin blockchain. Such tight integration with
business logic may be difficult with existing Lightning implementations focusing
on standalone operation. For such transactors, LDK offers the possibility of
integrating a library in their native runtime, storing and handling Lightning
data and events in the same way they do blockchain events.

### Wallet Management

LDK owns on-chain funds as long as they are claimable as a part of a Lightning output which can be contested - once a channel is closed and all on-chain outputs are spendable only by you, LDK provides you notifications that a UTXO is "yours" again and it is up to you to spend it as you wish.

Additionally, channel funding is accomplished with a generic API which notifies users of the output which needs to appear on-chain, which they can then create a transaction for. Once a transaction is created, LDK handles the rest. This is a large part of our API's goals - making it easier to integrate Lightning into existing on-chain wallets which have their own on-chain logic - without needing to move funds in and out of a separate Lightning wallet with on-chain transactions and a separate private key system.

LDK does not currently provide a sample wallet module, but its sample node implementation uses Bitcoin Core's wallet for UTXO management e.g. [here (opens new window)](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-sample/blob/2cd778e7acc959689e3b8462c529ffb3509aa1ec/src/main.rs#L245-L260)
